This following table features some important concepts, including the different routing types implemented by the server.

| Concept | Description |
| -- | -- |
| User    | Users perform administrative actions on the server              |
| Agent   | Agents represent SIP endpoints such as softphones and IP phones |
| Domain  | Enables the creation of isolated groups of Agents               |
| Peer    | Similar to Agents but without Domain boundaries                 |
| Gateway | SIP entity that allows call termination                         |
| DID     | Routes and translate calls between the PSTN and Routr         |
| Intra-Domain Routing  | Routing type for calling within the same Domain   |
| Domain Ingress Routing | Calling from the PSTN to an Agent or Peer        |
| Domain Egress Routing | Calling from an Agent to the PSTN thru a Gateway  |
| Peer Egress Routing | Similar to *DER* but applies only to Peers          |
