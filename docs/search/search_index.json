Intra-Domain Routing Intra-Domain Routing(IDR) offers a mechanism for user segmentation. For a small or medium size company a single domain may be sufficient, but for a multinational or an IP telephony service provider, it may not. For a small company with less than 50 users, you may define a domain sip.domain.com . Regardless of how many offices they have, chances are that they still need to communicate with each other, and therefore we keep them in the same domain. Needless to say, that in a company this size you are not going to run out usernames. A multinational company like Walmart have thousands of stores that operate independently. In such a case, you will need a multi-domain setting. For example, you may define the domains sip.0001.walmart.com and sip.0002.walmart.com , and... you get the idea. Double Agents Yes, you can have double Agents, or Agents that exist in a multi-domain setup. All you need to do is include the domain in the Agent's spec.domain[*] list. In the example before, john can send or receive calls from both domains, while the rest of the Agents are only allowed to call within the domain. Single Domain Example The following yaml configuration shows a simple setup, involving one Domain and two Agents: Domain configuration - apiVersion : v1beta1 kind : Domain metadata : name : Local Office spec : context : domainUri : sip.local Agents configuration - apiVersion : v1beta1 kind : Agent metadata : name : John Doe spec : credentials : username : john secret : 1234 domains : [ sip.local ] - kind : Agent apiVersion : v1beta1 metadata : name : Janie Doe spec : credentials : username : janie secret : 1234 domains : [ sip.local ] And voila! That's all the configuration you need for intra-domain communication. For calls outside the domain, see \"Domain Egress Routing\" section and to receive calls from the PSTN check section \"Domain Ingress Routing\" To configure your sip devices use information found in config/agents.yml . Also, you must use the Host/IP of Routr server as the OUTBOUND PROXY of your sip device. Routing Rules The following rules apply to Intra-Domain Routing: Agents can only call other Agents in the same Domain Agents must belong to a Domain Agents Are not allowed to send a Digest username different than the username in the From-Header Domain Ingress Routing The process of receiving a call from PSTN to a domain is known in Routr as Domain Ingress Routing(DIR) and it is done using Gateway. Gateways are defined in the yaml file config/gateways.yml . The following example shows a typical Gateway configuration. - apiVersion : v1beta1 kind : Gateway metadata : name : Plain Old Phone Service Provider spec : regService : host : sip.provider.net credentials : username : gwuser secret : gwsecret transport : udp registries : [ sip.nyc.provider.net ] # These are additional registrars within the provider s network You also need to define DIDs. Incoming calls from a DID will be routed to an existing Agent or Peer using the Address Of Record(AOR). The AOR must be available in the location service at the time of the call or the call will be rejected. Please examine the following example: - apiVersion : v1beta1 kind : DID metadata : gwRef : dd50baa4 geoInfo : city : Columbus, GA country : USA countryISOCode : US spec : location : telUri : tel:17066041487 aorLink : sip:john@sip.local # This is the sip uri of an agent that is expected to be logged in Easy right? Any incoming call from this Gateway and DID will be routed to \"Jhon Doe\" @ Ocean New York. Routing Rules As mention before, the path of an inbound PSTN call is determined by the spec.location block of a DID resource. The aorLink refers to an Address of Record(Agent or Peer) that is available in the location service . Domain Egress Routing Domain Egress Routing(DER) is the way that Routr deals with a call request to a callee that exists in the Public Switched Telephone Network(PSTN) and not in the callers' domain. The Egress Policy consists of a rule and a didRef , and it is defined in the spec.context section of Domains resources. The rule and didRef are defined as follows: rule is a regex to match callee in the call request. The location service will resort to this only after a search in the caller's Domain first. didRef is the identifier of the DID that will to route the call. This DID must already exist and have a parent Gateway. Routing Rules Agents can only perform outbound calls using the Egress Policy of their own Domains. Peers Routing Peers are very similar to Agents but they are not bound to any Domain, and they are usually collocated in the same network with Routr. A common case will be peering with Asterisk, where Asterisk acts as a Media Server and Routr is used for signaling. Peers can perform inbound/outbound signaling within the network without any special consideration since they exist inside the Location Service just like Agents. So it is possible to perform signaling from Peer to Peer, Peer to Agent. The same is true for Inbound from the PSTN. For example, we can redirect incoming calls from the PSTN using the spec.location settings in the dids.yml configuration file. Routing Rules Agents are not allowed to call Peers. A future version of the Peer resource will feature a spec.acceptFrom.* field to allow calls from Domains or specific Agents.","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"concepts/#intra-domain-routing","text":"Intra-Domain Routing(IDR) offers a mechanism for user segmentation.

This overview covers rctl syntax, describes the command operations and provides common examples. For details about each command, including all the supported flags and subcommands, see the rctl reference documentation. This tool ships separately from the Routr server. Syntax Use the following syntax to run rctl commands from your terminal window: rctl COMMAND [REF] [flags] where COMMAND , subcommand REF , and flags are: COMMAND : Specifies the operation that you want to perform on one or more resources. For example create, get, delete, locate(loc). subcommand : Specifies the resource type. Resource types are case-sensitive and you can specify the singular, plural, or abbreviated forms. For example, the following commands produce the same output: $ rctl get gateway gweef506 $ rctl get gateways gweef506 $ rctl get gw gweef506 REF : Specifies the reference to the resource. References are case-sensitive. If the reference is omitted, details for all resources are displayed. For example, $ rctl get agents . flags : Specifies optional flags. For example, you can use the --filter to further reduce the output of get command. The --filter flag uses JsonPath to perform the filtering. The root is always '$' so all you need to add is the path to the property and the filter operators. For example: # This will return all the DIDs in Gateway gweef506 ./rctl get dids --filter @.metadata.gwRef== gweef506 If you need help, just run rctl --help from the terminal window. $ ./rctl -h usage: rctl [ -h ] COMMAND ... rctl controls the Routr server named arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit Basic Commands: COMMAND get display a list of resources create ( crea ) creates new resource ( s ) apply apply changes over existing resource ( s ) delete ( del ) delete an existing resource ( s ) locate ( loc ) locate sip device ( s ) registry ( reg ) shows gateways registrations system ( sys ) display a list of resources login sets connection info More information at https://github.com/fonoster/routr/wiki Important : Some commands (ie.: create, delete) are not available in the default implementation of the resources modules.

The following illustration depicts our scenario: Content Requirements Configuration Overview Configuring Asterisk Calling Asterisk from John\u2019s device What\u2019s Next? Requirements This tutorial assumes the following: You have a SIP phone connected to the same LAN where Routr and Asterisk are in. If using a hardware phone, this can reach Asterisk and Routr and the other way around You have a fresh installation of Routr and Asterisk Before starting this guide make sure to have a fresh installation of Routr server. Configuration Overview With a fresh installation of Routr , you will have most of the configuration you need to follow this tutorial. We, however, need to make some minor changes to configuration files to run our scenario. The first file we will examine and change is config/peers.yml . Make note of the username and secret for the Peer \"ast\" since we will be using this to configure Asterisk. Also, search for the field spec.device and change it to match the Agents domain( sip.local ). The file now will look similar to this: config/peers.yml - apiVersion: v1beta1 kind: Peer metadata: name: Asterisk PBX spec: device: sip.local credentials: username: ast secret: 1234 Head to the console and run the command rctl -- get peers to confirm that the Peer exist. The result should be as follows: Next, we focus our attention on domains.yml and agents.yml . With a fresh installation, we don't need to make any changes to these files. However, you could run the commands get domains and get agents to ensure that both, the Agent and the Domain, exist on the server. Your output should look similar to: Use the information in agents.yml to configure your SIP phone. The relevant information is found in spec.credentials .

Keep in mind that Routr will only secure the signaling and that the endpoints are ultimately responsible for securing the media. For this guide, we will use a fictitious domain name to demonstrate the process of securing the signaling path Creating a Java Keystore(.JKS) Certificate Routr needs a keystore (.jks) in order to properly handling the certificates. The following steps will create a valid keystore file using a self-signed method or using the free Let's Encrypt service . Creating a self-signed Certificate Perhaps the easiest way to create a valid certificate for Routr is using a self-signed certificate. To generate the certificate change into etc/certs in your Routr installation and run the following script: keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA \\ -noprompt \\ -alias routr \\ -keystore domain-certs.jks \\ -storepass changeit \\ -keypass changeit \\ -validity 365 \\ -keysize 2048 \\ -dname CN=sip.ocean.com, OU=OSS, O=Your Company Inc, L=Sanford, ST=NC, C=US \\ -ext SAN = dns:sip.ocean.com,dns:localhost,ip:127.0.0.1 Remember to adjust the values to match your project's information. WSS will not work with a self-signed certificate. However, you can add a security exception by using https instead of wss in your browser's search bar and then accepting the security certificate. Creating a Certificate using Let\u2019s Encrypt The recommended way to create a valid certificate for Routr is using the free service Let's Encrypt . Please go to https://letsencrypt.org/ for details on how to install the required tooling. To generate the certificate, use the following steps: 1. Create keys certbot certonly --standalone -d sip.ocean.com --email admin@sip.ocean.com Change to the directory where the certificates were created(normally at /etc/letsencrypt/live/sip.ocean.com). 2. Create a PKCS12 file containing full chain and private key openssl pkcs12 -export -in fullchain.pem -inkey privkey.pem -out pkcs.p12 -name domains-cert.jks Please make note of the password since you will need it in the following step and also for your settings in Routr . 3. Convert PKCS12 to Keystore keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.pkcs12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore domains-cert.jks Installing the Certificate in Routr To enable secure signaling in Routr , copy your certificate in etc/certs and edit the file config/config.yml to look like this: apiVersion: v1beta1 metadata: userAgent: Routr v1.0 spec: securityContext: keyStore: etc/certs/domains-cert.jks trustStore: etc/certs/domains-cert.jks keyStorePassword: changeit trustStorePassword: changeit keyStoreType: jks debugging: true # Enabled debug only for testing transport: - protocol: tls port: 5061 ... With the property spec.securityContext.debugging set to true you can get some valuable information about the status of the configuration. You can also test your configuration using the following command: openssl s_client -host 192.168.1.2 -port 5061 # Remember to use Routr s IP Setting up the Sip Phones For the purpose of this guide, we are using Blink Pro . Go to the account that you want to secure, select Advanced - Sip Signaling and change the parameter Primary Proxy to ${proxyHost}:${proxyPort};transport=tls .

For a fair comparison, we separate this into two fundamental categories: SIP Servers, and PBX. Routr vs Asterisk/FreeSWITCH? Asterisk and FreeSWITCH fall into the PBX category. Their role is to provide media capabilities such as IVR, Voicemail, Conferencing, Recording and even video. Both, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, are very good at what they do each with their strengths and weaknesses. Routr is not a PBX and does not pretend to solve the same issue. Routr focuses in the SIP Server role. Routr vs Kamailio/OpenSER? Typically, large VoIP networks and Unified Communication platforms include SIP servers of some sort. The perform the following functions: Proxy, Registrar, Location, Forking, Redirect Load Balancing Session Border Controller Gateway to the PSTN Routr attempts to solve the same core problems as Kamailio/OpenSER but with a different approach. So what is the problem with Kamailio/OpenSER? Kamailio is an impressive piece of software but is not ready-to-use like Asterisk or FreeSWITCH, and to get it to work you will have to understand SIP and write some code. What can we do to make it better? Our vision for a Next-generation SIP Server can be summarized as follows: Make Routr Cloud-Native (After all it is 2019) It does not require any coding / Most use-cases are configurable Offer the tooling and APIs for easy extensibility Great documentation If you want to support the initiative please join the discussion .","title":"Comparison to Alternatives"},{"location":"introduction/comparison/#routr-vs-asteriskfreeswitch","text":"Asterisk and FreeSWITCH fall into the PBX category.

Features Routr's main features are: Typical Sip Server functions; Proxy, Registrar, Location Service Per node Multi-Tenancy/Multi-Domain with Domain level Access Control List Transport: TCP, UDP, TLS, WebSocket Routr currently support Redis, HTTP Requests, and YAML files as the data source Server management and monitoring with the RESTful API, CLI, and Web Console Configurable routing strategies; Intra-Domain, Domain Ingress, Domain Egress and Peer Egress Components The Routr ecosystem consists of three main components: The Routr server which is the main component of the ecosystem The command-line interface, rctl , for remote management of the server An optional web console for easy management of the server Architecture This diagram illustrates the architecture of Routr and some of its ecosystem components: At the center of Routr are the routing rules. These rules are the core of Routr, in addition to the typical SIP Server the functions such as Proxy, Location, and Registrar. The main integration points are the data abstraction layer, the event publisher, and the RESTful API. This integration points, allow for easy integration with third-party software. Use cases Routr specializes in the management of SIP resources and domain-centric routing strategies. It works well in front of the Media servers like Asterisk or FreeSWITCH. Routr runs in all major operating systems, in Docker , and can be deployed as in cloud system such as Kubernetes . Unlike Kamailio and OpenSIPS, Routr does not require any type of scripting to perform any of its typical routing tasks. Routing rules are configured not programmed.
