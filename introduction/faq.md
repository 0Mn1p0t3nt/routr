### What language is used to develop Routr?

Most Routr components are written in Javascript(with Oracle Nashorn).

### What happens once Nashorn is deprecated?

[JEP 335](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/335) is a concern. The current course of action is to wait and see if GraalJS is a viable replacement for Nashorn or re-write project entirely in Java. In either case, we believe we have time to make the decision later this year.
